"Z" and "X" Keys: Add and remove meshes, alternating between left and right up to a maximum of 50 meshes or a minimum of 1.
"Q" Key: Sequentially removes lights, starting from the last added, until there are none. Without lights, the mesh won't be visible, but this allows for appreciating the difference when a new light is added.
